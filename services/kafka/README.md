There are three docker-compose files, one for x64 architectures (normal computers), one for Raspberry Pis running a 32 bit architecture (-armv7l) and one for Raspberry Pis running a 64 bit architecture (a-aarch64).

Use the right one for your computer.

The images for aarch64 are built locally, based on slight modifications of fogsyio's images (which are used for armv7l).
